                    This section is currently under development. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource to help
                    identify plants that may be toxic to pets and humans.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" color="textSecondary" paragraph>
                    When completed, youâ€™ll be able to explore a variety of plants and learn about their potential health
                    risks. This feature will be especially useful for pet owners, gardeners, and anyone interested in
                    plant safety.
